<li>P/E Ratio (Price to Earnings)</li>
- The P/E ratio is a valuation metric that compares a company's current share price to its earnings per share
- ABC with a P/E of 100: This suggests that investors are willing to pay $100 for every $1 of earnings, which is quite high. This could be because the market expects ABC to grow rapidly in the future
- A very high P/E might suggest overvaluation or high future growth expectations, while a low P/E might indicate undervaluation or poor future prospects.

<li>Debt-to-Equity Ratio (D/E)</li>
- This ratio indicates the proportion of equity and debt the company is using to finance its assets. 
- A high D/E ratio suggests that a company may be risking more debt to finance its growth, which can be risky in turbulent times.

<li>Beta</li>
- Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility in relation to the overall market.
- A beta greater than 1.0 suggests that the stock is more volatile than the broader market, and a beta less than 1.0 indicates a stock with lower volatility.
- A beta of 1 The stock moves in line with the broader market, beta of 2 The stock moves twice as much as the broader market, beta of -1 The stock moves in the opposite direction of the broader market
- A beta value of 1.5 implies that the stock is 50% more volatile than the broader market. 

<li>Current Ratio</li>
- The current ratio—which is total current assets divided by total current liabilities—is commonly used by analysts to assess the ability of a company to meet its short-term obligations. 

<li>Market to Book Value</li>
- By comparing the company's market value to its book value, investors can, in part, determine whether a stock is under- or over-priced. 
- A company's book value is calculated by looking at the company's historical cost, or accounting value. 
- A firm's market value is determined by its share price in the stock market and the number of shares it has outstanding, which is its market capitalization
